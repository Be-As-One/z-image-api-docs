## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://z-image.vip/api/v1
```

## Authentication

All endpoints require authentication using Bearer token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

See 👉 [Authentication](../authentication) for details.

## Endpoints

The Z-Image API consists of two main endpoints:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Create Task" icon="plus" href="create-task">
    Submit a new image or video generation task
  </Card>
  <Card title="Get Task Status" icon="circle-check" href="get-task-status">
    Check the status and retrieve results
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Request Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Task">
    Submit a generation request with model and parameters
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Task ID">
    Get a unique task ID to track progress
  </Step>
  <Step title="Poll Status">
    Check task status every 2-5 seconds
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retrieve Result">
    Download generated content when status is "success"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Response Format

All API responses follow this structure:

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "message": "success",
  "data": {
    // Response data varies by endpoint
  }
}
```

### Success Response

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "message": "success",
  "data": { /* ... */ }
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Invalid request parameters",
  "data": null
}
```

## Error Codes

| Code | Meaning | Common Causes |
|------|---------|---------------|
| 200 | Success | Request completed successfully |
| 400 | Bad Request | Invalid parameters or missing required fields |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Invalid or missing API key |
| 402 | Payment Required | Insufficient credits |
| 404 | Not Found | Task or resource doesn't exist |
| 500 | Server Error | Internal server error |

## Rate Limits

By default, we apply the following limits:
- Up to 100 new generation requests per minute
- Up to 1,000 requests per hour
- Limits are applied per API key

<Note>
For most users, this is more than sufficient. If you consistently hit rate limits, contact 👉 [support](../../resources/support) to request a higher limit.
</Note>

## Webhooks

You can optionally provide a `callBackUrl` when creating tasks to receive notifications when tasks complete.

See 👉 [Webhooks](webhooks) for details.

## Supported Models

Z-Image API currently supports two core models:

### Text to Image
- **seedream-text-to-image** - High-quality text to image generation with up to 4K resolution

### Image to Video
- **wan22-video-generation** - Animate your images with Wan 2.2 model (5-12 second videos)

See 👉 [Create Task](create-task) for detailed parameter documentation.

## Credits System

All operations consume credits based on:
- Model complexity
- Resolution/quality settings
- Processing time

The `creditsUsed` field in the create task response shows how many credits were deducted.

<Tip>
  Check your credit balance in the 👉 [dashboard](https://z-image.vip/admin) before submitting large batches. See 👉 [Pricing](../../getting-started/pricing) for detailed costs.
</Tip>

## Versioning

The current API version is **v1**. All endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1/`.

Future versions will be released with different prefixes (e.g., `/api/v2/`) to maintain backward compatibility.
