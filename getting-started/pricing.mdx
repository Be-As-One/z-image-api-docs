## How Credits Work

We use a credit-based system. Each generation consumes credits based on model and parameters.

**Credit Pricing:**
- 1 credit = $0.01 USD
- Minimum purchase: 100 credits ($1)
- Credits never expire

## Image Generation Costs

| Model | Resolution | Credits | Cost |
|-------|-----------|---------|------|
| Seedream | 2K | 5 | $0.05 |
| Seedream | 4K | 8 | $0.08 |

**Example:** Generating 100 images at 2K costs 500 credits ($5).

## Video Generation Costs

| Duration | Resolution | Credits | Cost |
|----------|-----------|---------|------|
| 5s | 1280x720 or 720x1280 | 15 | $0.15 |
| 8s | 1280x720 or 720x1280 | 22 | $0.22 |
| 12s | 1280x720 or 720x1280 | 28 | $0.28 |

**Example:** Creating 10 five-second videos costs 150 credits ($1.50).

## Failed Tasks

**We don't charge for failures.** If a task fails due to our system issues, credits are automatically refunded.

**User-caused failures** (invalid prompts, unsupported formats) consume credits. Check parameters before submitting.

| Replicate Flux | $0.025 | N/A | N/A |
