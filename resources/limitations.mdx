## We're Not Perfect

We're transparent about what works and what doesn't. This page lists known limitations and workarounds.

## Model Limitations

### Seedream (Image Generation)

**What works well:**
- Natural landscapes and architecture
- Objects and products
- Abstract art and patterns
- Photorealistic scenes

**Known issues:**
- Text in images often distorted or misspelled
- Complex hands and fingers (common AI issue)
- Very specific brand logos may not match reality
- Multiple people in one scene can have inconsistent styles

**Not supported:**
- Explicit NSFW content (blocked by content filter)
- Deepfakes or impersonation of real people
- Copyrighted characters (Disney, Marvel, etc.)

### Wan 2.2 (Video Generation)

**What works well:**
- Camera movements (zoom, pan, tilt)
- Simple subject motion (walking, turning head)
- Nature scenes (flowing water, blowing leaves)
- Portrait animation

**Known issues:**
- Complex multi-step actions often fail
- Fast motion can introduce artifacts
- Physics not always realistic (gravity, momentum)
- Long videos (12s) have more quality variance

**Not supported:**
- Multiple subjects with independent motion
- Text appearing/disappearing in video
- Extreme camera angles or distortion

## API Limitations

**Rate Limits:**
- 100 requests per minute per API key
- 1,000 requests per hour per API key
- No bulk submission endpoint (submit one by one)

**Task Limits:**
- Maximum 5 concurrent tasks per account
- Tasks timeout after 10 minutes of processing
- No priority queue (first come, first served)

**File Size:**
- Image inputs for video: max 10MB
- Output images: typically 2-8MB
- Output videos: typically 5-30MB

**Content Policies:**
- NSFW detection is automated and may have false positives
- Appeals process not available yet
- Blocked content costs credits (working on refund logic)

## Infrastructure

**Uptime:**
- No SLA guarantee yet
- Typical availability: ~99% (based on last 90 days)
- Maintenance windows announced 24 hours ahead

**Geographic Limitations:**
- Servers in US East (latency varies globally)
- No edge locations or CDN acceleration
- Some countries may have slow upload speeds

**Scaling:**
- During peak hours (9am-11am UTC), queue times increase
- No auto-scaling yet (we manually add capacity)
- Large traffic spikes may cause temporary slowdowns

## Feature Requests We've Received

**Not planned:**
- Video-to-video transformation
- Style transfer between images
- Batch processing with CSV upload

**Under consideration:**
- More aspect ratios (2:1, 4:5)
- Longer video durations (30s, 60s)
- Custom LoRA model support
- API key permission scopes

**Planned for Q2 2025:**
- WebSocket status updates (replace polling)
- Credit usage analytics dashboard
- Team accounts with role management

## Workarounds

### Slow Response Times

**Problem:** API responses take >30 seconds

**Workarounds:**
- Use shorter video durations (5s instead of 12s)
- Lower resolution for testing (2K instead of 4K)
- Submit during off-peak hours (after 12pm UTC)

### NSFW False Positives

**Problem:** Safe content blocked as NSFW

**Workarounds:**
- Rephrase prompt to avoid trigger words
- Try different aspect ratio
- Contact 👉 [support](support) with task ID (we'll review manually)

### Task Stuck in "Running"

**Problem:** Task shows "running" for >5 minutes

**Workarounds:**
- Wait 10 minutes (some complex tasks take longer)
- Check 👉 [status page](https://status.z-image.vip)
- Submit new task with same parameters
- Original task will auto-fail after 10 minutes (credits refunded)
